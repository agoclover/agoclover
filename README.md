**agoclover/agoclover** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I'm a data science learner who is passionate about big data technologies and of course open-source community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Apache projects such as Hadoop, Spark and Flink. I recently was selected to be an Arctic Code Vault Contributor on [agoclover/machine_learning](https://github.com/agoclover/machine_learning).
